Tracker for stock tickers

# What

Moment, or MMNT is a ticker tracker for the NASDAQ. It will periodically
monitor the tickers on the NASDAQ for trading volume - and will send you a
notification when the trading volume of a ticker exceeds 10x the average of
the past 3 days. In this market of insider trading and rampant speculation,
hopefully it can inform you about a burst in trading volume before the price
change follows. It will also monitor specific tickers that you request and
notify you daily about the total volume and price spreads from open to close.
It'll have charts.

MMNT gets it name from the ticker of the same name which tracks
Momentous Holdings, a penny stock trading at a volume of 4000 and going for
about 20 cents. It has 2 employees. Its a small, penny traded stock that
barely sees any activity and is worth barely any money per share. But,
back in April of this year, its trading volume increased from a volume
average of 150 to 120 thousand, which brought gains of more than 60% at
the top. The massive volume increase preceeded the price increase by about
a trading day, and the top by about a week. MMNT the app seeks to capture
tickers like MMNT whenever its next great pop and drop happens.

## Development

Moment is developed in the Open on GitHub at:

If you know a few things about Android programming and are wanting to help
out with development you can do so by creating issue tickets to squash bugs,
and propose feature requests for future inclusion.`

# Issues or Questions

Please post any issues with the code in the Issues section on GitHub. Pull Requests
will be accepted on GitHub only after extensive reading and as long as the request
goes in line with the design of the application. Pull Requests will only be
accepted for new features of the application, for general purpose bug fixes, creating
an issue is simply faster.
